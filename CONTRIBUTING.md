Contributing
------------

How I've been doing it: 

1. Create a new branch (titled appropriately)
2. Commit changes to new branch. 
3. Submit pull request. 

Once I take a look, I'll probably accept the request and delete the branch. Please do not commit directly to the main branch. 

If you think I'm doing something wrong or have a suggestion for a better guideline for contributing, please let me know.
